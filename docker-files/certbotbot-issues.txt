Question? will each certificate be manually created, then only the certbot lestencrypt script needs to renew ?

for wildcard cert as well as port 80. The letsencrypt creates the certs as user root, so user of nginx 101 in container cant read - to solve I created a container 

nginx wont start unless it has a certificate - needs docker health check or the like

how to restart the nginx service within the container so that it can use the renewed cert - found the correct command

https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/how-to-change-the-installation-path-of-certbot/76479  -  --config-dir /some/other-path
that doesnt work

MAKE script to edit nginx.conf with correct domain name , so don't bother with generic at all
